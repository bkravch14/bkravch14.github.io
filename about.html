			<p> Talking about myself,football is one of the hobbies that I really enjoy. Since  2015 I am in the Moose Football team, and for me personally it is a great privilege and a great opportunity to compete with other teams from Klaipeda. I believe that football is a sport that brings people together, that unites people from different nations, into one group that loves this game. I believe that our team is a great example of how people should work together and support each other during the matches. For me, as I am a goalkeeper, it is really important to provide confidence to my team that I am the one who will make a difference in the game; I am the who is supposed to lead a team in some certain occasions,  so our performance would be as great as possible.

			<p> Talking about my education, I am currently completing a Bachelor's Degree in International Business Administration at LCC International University, Lithuania. In my opinion, education at LCC is the significant step that I should go through to become a decent businessmen and open-minded person. This is a place where I not only get important business knowledge, but also acquire valuable lessons about how to behave and treat people in the future life. Everyday LCC gives students an opportunity to meet a lot of people from countries all over the world which teaches me that in the future it is important to take into the consideration cultural dimensions, while communicating with people and creating own business. Moreover, the university teaches its students responsibility, which is an extremely valuable trait of character to obtain to become a reliable person.
