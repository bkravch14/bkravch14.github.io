			<p> During my education and life in general I participated in projects, events and competitions. One of the latest activities in which I participated was a “Donation for a good cause" fundrasing, which our small organized in order to help collect money for a pet shelter.I believe that such an event is an extremely helpful way to help people and animals in need, and to make our society a little bit happier and more developed. Through such small steps people who have some extra money can share it with organizations in need, which in turn will bring positive emotions to the new owners of the animals. This, consequently, leads to an increase in a public welfare and progress of a society, in which people get a possibility to adopt a pet, as well as organizations have enough money to maintain solid conditions for animals.
